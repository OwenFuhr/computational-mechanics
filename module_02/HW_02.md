## Problems [Part 1](./01_Cheers_Stats_Beers.md)

1. Gordon Moore created an empirical prediction that the rate of
semiconductors on a computer chip would double every two years. This
prediction was known as Moore's law. Gordon Moore had originally only
expected this empirical relation to hold from 1965 - 1975
[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law),[2](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress)],
but semiconductor manufacturers were able to keep up with Moore's law
until 2015. 

In the folder "../data" is a comma separated value (CSV) file,
"transistor_data.csv" [taken from wikipedia
01/2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors).

a. Use the `!head ../data/transistor_data.csv` command to look at
the top of the csv. What are the headings for the columns?

b. Load the csv into a pandas dataframe. How many missing values
(`NaN`) are
in the column with the number of transistors? What fraction are
missing?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Part a
!head ../data/transistor_data.csv

transistor_data = pd.read_csv('../data/transistor_data.csv')

#Part b dapted from Part 1
def NaN_Tool(myset):
    '''
    Takes a data series, myset, and returns the number of NaNs in the values and the fraction of the values
    that are NaN
    '''
    num_NaN = len(myset.values)-len(myset.dropna().values)
    frac_NaN = num_NaN/len(myset.values)
    
    return num_NaN, frac_NaN

transistors = transistor_data['MOS transistor count']

num_NaN, frac_NaN = NaN_Tool(transistors)

print("\n\nThere are {} missing (NaN) values in the transistor data set. NaN values constitute {:.2f}% of the dataset".format(num_NaN, frac_NaN*100))
```

## Problems [Part 2](./02_Seeing_Stats.md)

1. Many beers do not report the IBU of the beer because it is very
small. You may be accidentally removing whole categories of beer from
our dataset by removing rows that do not include the IBU measure. 

    a. Use the command `beers_filled = beers.fillna(0)` to clean the `beers` dataframe
    
    b. Repeat the steps above to recreate the plot "Beer ABV vs. IBU mean values by style" 
    scatter plot with `beers_filled`. What differences do you notice between the plots?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Part a
beers = pd.read_csv("../data/beers.csv")

beers_cleaned = beers.dropna()
beers_filled = beers.fillna(0)

#Part b

#Plotting cleaned
plt.figure(1)
plt.scatter(beers_cleaned["abv"],beers_cleaned["ibu"])
plt.xlabel("ABV")
plt.ylabel("IBU")
plt.title("Beer IBU vs. ABV - Cleaned out NaN")

#Plotting filled
plt.figure(2)
plt.scatter(beers_filled["abv"],beers_filled["ibu"])
plt.xlabel("ABV")
plt.ylabel("IBU")
plt.title("Beer IBU vs. ABV - NaN filled with 0")
```

## End of Part b: 
By comparing the graphs above it can be noticed that cleaning the data removes a large category of beer with no IBU but an ABV value.

2. Gordon Moore created an empirical prediction that the rate of
semiconductors on a computer chip would double every two years. This
prediction was known as Moore's law. Gordon Moore had originally only
expected this empirical relation to hold from 1965 - 1975
[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law),[2](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress)],
but semiconductor manufacturers were able to keep up with Moore's law

    In the folder "../data" is a comma separated value (CSV) file, "transistor_data.csv" [taken from wikipedia 01/2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors). 
    Load the csv into a pandas dataframe, it has the following headings:

    |Processor| MOS transistor count| Date of Introduction|Designer|MOSprocess|Area|
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|

    a. In the years 2017, what was the average MOS transistor count? 
    Make a boxplot of the transistor count in 2017 and find the first, second and third quartiles.

    b. Create a semilog y-axis scatter plot (i.e. `plt.semilogy`) for the 
    "Date of Introduction" vs "MOS transistor count". 
    Color the data according to the "Designer".

```{code-cell} ipython3
transistors = pd.read_csv("../data/transistor_data.csv")

#Part a
#Isolate rows from 2017, transistor count from 2017
yr2017 = transistors[transistors["Date of Introduction"]==2017]
count = yr2017["MOS transistor count"]

#Find and print the mean
print("The mean MOS transistor count for the year 2017 was {:0.0} transistors per chip".format(np.mean(count)))
#Plot results
plt.boxplot(count, labels=["MOS transistor count"]);
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Part b
from matplotlib import cm

#Narrow down data set
focus_grp = transistors.drop(['Processor','MOSprocess','Area'],axis=1)

designers = focus_grp["Designer"].unique()
colors = cm.get_cmap('inferno',len(designers))

#Enumerate each designer and assign a color to each (adapted from professor's work)
for i, name in enumerate(designers):
    row = data[data['Designer']==name]
    
    plt.semilogy(row['Date of Introduction'],
                 row['MOS transistor count'],
                 's',
                 label = name,
                 color = colors((i+1)/len(designers)))
    plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor = (1.05,1))
```

## Problems [Part 3](03_Linear_Regression_with_Real_Data.md)

1. There is a csv file in '../data/primary-energy-consumption-by-region.csv' that has the energy consumption of different regions of the world from 1965 until 2018 [Our world in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy). 
Compare the energy consumption of the United States to all of Europe. Load the data into a pandas dataframe. *Note: you can get certain rows of the data frame by specifying what you're looking for e.g. 
`EUR = dataframe[dataframe['Entity']=='Europe']` will give us all the rows from Europe's energy consumption.*

    a. Plot the total energy consumption of the United States and Europe
    
    b. Use a linear least-squares regression to find a function for the energy consumption as a function of year
    
    energy consumed = $f(t) = At+B$
    
    c. At what year would you change split the data and use two lines like you did in the 
    land temperature anomoly? Split the data and perform two linear fits. 
    
    d. What is your prediction for US energy use in 2025? How about European energy use in 2025?

```{code-cell} ipython3
energy = pd.read_csv('../data/primary-energy-consumption-by-region.csv')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Part a
#See what the headers are
print(energy.columns)
print('\nEntities containing U and S:')
#Find what the United States is listed as (US/USA/United States) - Visually inspect
for entity in energy['Entity'].unique():
    if entity.__contains__("U") and entity.__contains__("S") == True:
        print(entity)

#Set up data sets

US = energy[energy['Entity']=='United States']
EUR = energy[energy['Entity']=='Europe']

US_cons = US["Primary Energy Consumption (terawatt-hours)"]
EU_cons = EUR["Primary Energy Consumption (terawatt-hours)"]

#Plot
plt.figure(1, figsize=(8,5))
plt.plot(US["Year"], US_cons, 'r-', label="US consumption")
plt.plot(US["Year"], EU_cons, 'b-', label="Europe consumption")

plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Energy Consumption (TW-Hrs)")

plt.title("US and Europe Energy Consumption vs. Year")
plt.legend();
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Part b

#Get types set up
yeari = US["Year"].values
USi = US_cons.values
EUi = EU_cons.values

#US linear fit
A_US, B_US = np.polyfit(yeari, USi, 1)
US_fit = np.poly1d((A_US, B_US))
#Europe linear fit
A_EU, B_EU = np.polyfit(yeari, EUi, 1)
EU_fit = np.poly1d((A_EU, B_EU))

#Replot Data
plt.figure(2, figsize=(8,5))

plt.plot(US["Year"], US_cons, 'r-', label="US consumption")
plt.plot(US["Year"], EU_cons, 'b-', label="Europe consumption")

plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Energy Consumption (TW-Hrs)")

plt.title("US and Europe Energy Consumption vs. Year - Linear fits")


#Plot fits
plt.plot(yeari, US_fit(yeari), "g--",label="US Fit", linewidth=1.5)
plt.plot(yeari, EU_fit(yeari), "k--",label="Europe Fit", linewidth=1.5)

plt.legend();
```

## Split Regression

Based on qualitative analysis of the data, I have decided to split the data at 1995, as this seems like it is an inflection point when energy use begins to level out.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Part c
#Find 1995 in the years
split_idx = np.where(yeari == 1995)[0]

#Split the years, consumption data up
years1, US1, EU1 = yeari[0:split_idx[0]+1], USi[0:split_idx[0]+1], EUi[0:split_idx[0]+1]
years2, US2, EU2 = yeari[split_idx[0]:], USi[split_idx[0]:], EUi[split_idx[0]:]


#Perform linear regressions for US and Europe consumption data on both sets of years

#US 1965-1995 linear fit
A_US1, B_US1 = np.polyfit(years1, US1, 1)
US_fit1 = np.poly1d((A_US1, B_US1))
#Europe 1965-1995 linear fit
A_EU1, B_EU1 = np.polyfit(years1, EU1, 1)
EU_fit1 = np.poly1d((A_EU1, B_EU1))

#US 1995-2018 linear fit
A_US2, B_US2 = np.polyfit(years2, US2, 1)
US_fit2 = np.poly1d((A_US2, B_US2))
#Europe 1995-2018 linear fit
A_EU2, B_EU2 = np.polyfit(years2, EU2, 1)
EU_fit2 = np.poly1d((A_EU2, B_EU2))

#Replot Data
plt.figure(2, figsize=(8,5))

plt.plot(US["Year"], US_cons, 'r-', label="US consumption")
plt.plot(US["Year"], EU_cons, 'b-', label="Europe consumption")

plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Energy Consumption (TW-Hrs)")

plt.title("US and Europe Energy Consumption vs. Year - Linear fits split at 1995")

#Plot split fits
plt.plot(years1, US_fit1(years1), "g--",label="US Fit 1965-1995", linewidth=1.5)
plt.plot(years1, EU_fit1(years1), "k--",label="Europe Fit 1965-1995", linewidth=1.5)

plt.plot(years2, US_fit2(years2), "y--",label="US Fit 1995-2018", linewidth=1.5)
plt.plot(years2, EU_fit2(years2), "c--",label="Europe Fit 1995-2018", linewidth=1.5)

plt.legend();
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Part d

print('''From the parameters of the linear regressions performed on energy usage data for from 1995-2018:
The energy usage in the year 2025 will be ~ {:0.0f} TW-Hrs in the United States and ~ {:0.0f} TW-Hrs in Europe'''.format(US_fit2(2025), EU_fit2(2025)))
```

2. You plotted Gordon Moore's empirical prediction that the rate of semiconductors on a computer chip would double every two years in [02_Seeing_Stats](./02_Seeing_Stats). This prediction was known as Moore's law. Gordon Moore had originally only expected this empirical relation to hold from 1965 - 1975 [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law),[2](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress)], but semiconductor manufacuturers were able to keep up with Moore's law until 2015. 

Use a linear regression to find our own historical Moore's Law.    

Use your code from [02_Seeing_Stats](./02_Seeing_Stats) to plot the semilog y-axis scatter plot 
(i.e. `plt.semilogy`) for the "Date of Introduction" vs "MOS transistor count". 
Color the data according to the "Designer".

Create a linear regression for the data in the form of 

$log(transistor~count)= f(date) = A\cdot date+B$

rearranging

$transistor~count= e^{f(date)} = e^B e^{A\cdot date}$

You can perform a least-squares linear regression using the following assignments

$x_i=$ `dataframe['Date of Introduction'].values`

and

$y_i=$ as `np.log(dataframe['MOS transistor count'].values)`

a. Plot your function on the semilog y-axis scatter plot

b. What are the values of constants $A$ and $B$ for our Moore's law fit? How does this compare to Gordon Moore's prediction that MOS transistor count doubles every two years?

```{code-cell} ipython3
data = pd.read_csv('../data/transistor_data.csv')
data = data.dropna()
xi=data['Date of Introduction'].values
TC=data['MOS transistor count'].values

#Part a
plt.figure(1, figsize=(8,5))
plt.semilogy(xi, TC,'s')
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("MOS Transistor Count (log scale)")
plt.title("Semilog y-axis Plot of MOS Transistor Count vs. Year")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
#Part b

#Replot Data
plt.figure(1, figsize=(8,5))
plt.semilogy(xi, TC,'bo')

A_moore, B_moore = np.polyfit(xi, np.log(TC),1)
moore_fit = np.poly1d((A_moore, B_moore))
print("The transistor data can be fit with an equation in the form A*x+B -> {}".format(moore_fit))

#Plot curve fit with function to e to cancel ln
plt.plot(xi, np.exp(moore_fit(xi)), "r--",label="Linear Fit")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("MOS Transistor Count (log scale)")
plt.title("Semilog y-axis Plot of MOS Transistor Count vs. Year")
plt.legend()
```

### Values for A and  B

```{code-cell} ipython3
demoyr = [1970,2020]
print('''On a log scale, the slope of the linear fit is ~ {:0.2f}, meaning that the number of transistors
doubles roughly every two years.'''.format(np.exp(A_moore)))
```

## Problems [Part 4](04_Stats_and_Montecarlo.md)

__1.__ [Buffon's needle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon) is
another way to estimate the value of $\pi$ with random numbers. The goal
in this Monte Carlo estimate of $\pi$ is to create a ratio that is close
to [3.1415926...](http://www.math.com/tables/constants/pi.htm) _similar
to the example with darts points lying inside/outside a unit circle
inside a unit square._ 

![Buffon's needle for parallel
lines](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Buffon_needle.gif)

In this Monte Carlo estimation, you only need to know two values:
- the distance from line 0, $x = [0,~1]$
- the orientation of the needle, $\theta = [0,~2\pi]$

The y-location does not affect the outcome of crosses line 0 or not
crossing line 0. 

__a.__ Generate 100 random `x` and `theta` values _remember_ $\theta =
[0,~2\pi]$

__b.__ Calculate the x locations of the 100 needle ends e.g. $x_end = x
\pm \cos\theta$ _since length is unit 1. 

__c.__ Use 
[`np.logical_and`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.logical_and.html)
to find the number of needles that have minimum $x_{end~min}<0$ and
maximum $x_{end~max}>0$. The ratio
$\frac{x_{end~min}<0~and~x_{end~max}>0}{number~of~needles} =
\frac{2}{\pi}$ _for large values of $number~of~needles$_.

__2.__ Build a random walk data set with steps between $dx = dy =
-1/2~to~1/2~m$. If 100 particles take 10 steps, calculate the number of
particles that move further than 0.5 m. 

_Bonus: Can you do the work without any `for`-loops? Change the size of
`dx` and `dy` to account for multiple particles._

```{code-cell} ipython3
from numpy.random import default_rng
rng = default_rng()


#Part a, generating x and theta values
needles = 100
x = rng.random(needles)
theta = rng.random(needles)*2*np.pi

#Part b
x_ends = np.vstack([x+np.cos(theta), x-np.cos(theta)])

#Part c
crossingnum = np.sum(np.logical_and(x_ends[0,:]>0, x_ends[1,:]<0))

res = 2*(crossingnum/needles)

print("This simulation approximates 2/pi as {}. The numpy approximation of 2/pi is {}".format(res, 2/np.pi))

#Part 2
N_steps = 10
dx = rng.random(N_steps) - 0.5
dy = rng.random(N_steps) - 0.5

#Adapted from Professor's work (04_Stats_and_Montecarlo)
num_particles = 100
r_final = np.zeros((num_particles, 2))
for i in range(0, num_particles):
    r = np.zeros((N_steps, 2))
    dx = rng.random(N_steps) - 0.5
    dy = rng.random(N_steps) - 0.5
    r[:, 0] = np.cumsum(dx)
    r[:, 1] = np.cumsum(dy)
    r_final[i, :] = r[-1, :]

    plt.plot(r[:, 0 ], r[:, 1], alpha = 0.2)
plt.plot(r_final[:, 0], r_final[:, 1], 'o', markersize = 10)

#Assuming greater than 0.5m resultant in either x or y
num_over = np.sum(np.logical_or(abs(r_final[:,0])>0.5, abs(r_final[:,1]>0.5)))

print("\nPart 2:\nA total of {} particles went over 0.5 meters in the x or y direction during this random walk.".format(num_over))
```

__3.__ 100 steel rods are going to be used to support a 1000 kg structure. The
rods will buckle when the load in any rod exceeds the [critical buckling
load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_critical_load)

$P_{cr}=\frac{\pi^3 Er^4}{16L^2}$

where E=200e9 Pa, r=0.01 m +/-0.001 m, and L is the 
length of the rods supporting the structure. Create a Monte
Carlo model `montecarlo_buckle` that predicts 
the mean and standard deviation of the buckling load for 100
samples with normally distributed dimensions r and L. 

```python
mean_buckle_load,std_buckle_load=\
montecarlo_buckle(E,r_mean,r_std,L,N=100)
